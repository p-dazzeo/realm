# Modular Architecture Improvements

This document outlines the architectural improvements made to the REALM backend.

## Overview

The REALM backend has undergone significant architectural improvements to enhance maintainability, scalability, and code organization. These improvements were implemented in phases as outlined in the [Implementation Plan](../../../../PLAN.md).

## Completed Improvements

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes & Foundational Changes

1. **Service Layer Indentation ✅**
   - Fixed indentation of additional file methods inside the UploadService class
   - Added `additional_files_dir` setting in core/config.py
   - Result: Improved code readability and fixed potential bugs

2. **FileStorageService ✅**
   - Created new file `backend/shared/services/file_storage.py`
   - Implemented methods for save, retrieve, delete operations
   - Extracted file handling logic from UploadService
   - Result: Separation of concerns, improved testability, and reusable file storage logic

3. **Database Repositories ✅**
   - Created `backend/modules/upload/repositories.py`
   - Implemented ProjectRepository, FileRepository, AdditionalFileRepository, and UploadSessionRepository
   - Moved DB queries from service layer to repositories
   - Result: Cleaner service layer, better separation of concerns, and improved testability

### Phase 2: Architectural Improvements

4. **Custom Exception Handling ✅**
   - Created `backend/shared/exceptions.py` with domain-specific exceptions
   - Updated services to use custom exceptions
   - Added exception handlers to router
   - Result: Better error messages, consistent error handling, and improved client experience

5. **Configuration Management ✅**
   - Updated `core/config.py` with validated settings
   - Added configuration validation on startup
   - Implemented environment-based configuration
   - Result: More robust configuration system, improved error detection, and better environment support

6. **Router Organization ✅**
   - Split router.py into feature-specific routers (project_router.py, file_router.py, health_router.py)
   - Created a main router that includes sub-routers
   - Result: Better code organization, improved maintainability, and clearer API structure

## Benefits

These architectural improvements provide several benefits:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear responsibility
2. **Improved Testability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to test
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand
4. **Better Error Handling**: Custom exceptions provide clearer error messages
5. **Scalability**: The modular architecture makes it easier to add new features
6. **Configuration Robustness**: Environment-based configuration with validation

## Next Steps

The next phase of improvements (Phase 3) will focus on advanced features:

1. **API Versioning**
2. **Domain Events**
3. **Enhanced Dependency Injection**

These features will further enhance the architecture and provide a solid foundation for future development.
