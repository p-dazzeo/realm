# TODO: Backend Architecture & Refactoring

This document outlines future improvements and architectural considerations for the REALM backend.

## 🎉 PHASE 1 + PROJECTS MODULE COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ What We've Accomplished
- ✅ **Modular Architecture Foundation**: Complete directory restructure with feature-based modules
- ✅ **Core Infrastructure**: Enhanced configuration, database setup, and dependency injection
- ✅ **Upload Module Extraction**: Fully migrated upload functionality to `modules/upload/`
- ✅ **Shared Components**: Base models and cross-cutting concerns established
- ✅ **Enhanced Configuration**: Separated settings by module with environment prefixes
- ✅ **Clean Imports**: All imports updated to use new modular structure
- ✅ **Projects Module**: Complete enhanced project management system
  - ✅ 6 comprehensive models (templates, collaboration, settings, versions, analytics)
  - ✅ 30+ schemas with full validation and documentation
  - ✅ Advanced service layer with 20+ business logic methods
  - ✅ 17 API endpoints with comprehensive functionality
  - ✅ Template system with categories and usage tracking
  - ✅ Team collaboration with role-based access control
  - ✅ Version management and project snapshots
  - ✅ Multi-format export functionality (ZIP, JSON, PDF, Markdown)
  - ✅ Advanced search and filtering capabilities

## 🏗️ Current State Analysis

### ✅ Strengths (ENHANCED)
- ✅ **Clean Modular Architecture**: Feature-based modules with clear boundaries
- ✅ **Enhanced Configuration**: Separated CoreSettings, UploadSettings, and ProjectsSettings
- ✅ **Shared Base Classes**: Eliminate code duplication across modules
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: Clean FastAPI dependency system
- ✅ **Intelligent upload system**: Preserved with fallback logic
- ✅ **Comprehensive API documentation**: Maintained through refactoring
- ✅ **Structured logging and error handling**: Enhanced with modular imports
- ✅ **Flexible database schema**: Improved with base model inheritance
- ✅ **Enhanced Project Management**: Templates, collaboration, versioning, analytics

- ✅ **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Multiple criteria and pagination

### 🔧 Current Challenges
- ⚠️ **Database Connection**: Server startup may need DB configuration
- ⚠️ **Legacy Code Cleanup**: Old `app/` directory still exists for reference
- ⚠️ **Testing Coverage**: No comprehensive tests yet (foundation ready)
- ⚠️ **Authentication**: No auth system yet (planned for Phase 2)

3. **Module-specific Configuration**: Follow `core/config.py` separation pattern
4. **Dependency Injection**: Use `core/dependencies.py` patterns

### 🛠 Development Guidelines
- **Modular First**: Each feature should be self-contained
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests for new modules
- **Documentation**: Update docs as features are added
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API contracts
