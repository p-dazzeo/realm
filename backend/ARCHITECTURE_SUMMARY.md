├── pyproject.toml           # Dependencies
└── README.md               # Documentation
```

### Key Features
- ✅ Intelligent upload system (parser → direct fallback)
- ✅ PostgreSQL with JSONB support
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Structured logging
- ✅ External parser service integration

## 🎯 Proposed Modular Architecture

## 🚀 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Create new directory structure
- [ ] Extract core infrastructure components
- [ ] Move upload module to new structure
- [ ] Update imports and test functionality

### Phase 2: New Modules (1-2 months)
- [ ] **Projects Module**: CRUD operations, collaboration features
- [ ] **Chat Module**: LLM integration, conversation management
- [ ] **GenDoc Module**: Documentation generation in multiple formats

### Phase 3: Enhancement (3-6 months)
- [ ] **Auth Module**: JWT authentication, user management
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Add background job processing
- [ ] Create deployment configurations
- [ ] Add monitoring and analytics

## 🎯 Expected Benefits

### Development Benefits
- **Modular Development**: Teams can work on different modules independently
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each feature has its own domain and responsibilities
- **Better Testing**: Isolated unit tests for each module
- **Code Reusability**: Shared components reduce duplication

### Operational Benefits
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features and scale individual modules
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner code organization and easier navigation
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Can evolve toward microservices if needed
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries and caching strategies

### User Benefits
- **Faster Feature Development**: New capabilities can be added more quickly
- **Better Reliability**: Isolated modules reduce system-wide failures
- **Enhanced Features**: New modules will provide richer functionality

## 📊 Current vs Future Comparison

| Aspect | Current | Future |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Structure** | Monolithic app/ directory | Modular feature-based |
| **Features** | Upload only | Upload + Projects + Chat + GenDoc + Auth |
| **Testing** | Limited | Comprehensive per-module |
| **Scalability** | Single service | Module-based scaling |
| **Team Work** | Sequential development | Parallel module development |
| **Maintenance** | Coupled components | Isolated concerns |
