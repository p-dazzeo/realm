- **Project**: REALM Backend Feature Removal
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Author**: Development Team

## üéØ Executive Summary

### Objective
Simplify the REALM backend by removing advanced project management features and focusing exclusively on core codebase upload, storage, and retrieval functionality.

### Rationale
- **Complexity Reduction**: Current advanced features add unnecessary complexity for the core use case
- **Maintenance Burden**: Collaboration, analytics, and templating features require ongoing maintenance
- **Focus**: Concentrate development efforts on perfecting the core upload and analysis pipeline
- **Performance**: Reduce database complexity and improve core functionality performance

## üî• Features to Remove

### 1. Project Templates System
**Current Implementation**: Complete template creation, management, and usage system
- Template CRUD operations
- Template categories and metadata
- Template application to new projects

**Removal Scope**: Entire templates subsystem

### 2. Collaboration Features
**Current Implementation**: Multi-user project access and team management
- User roles (owner, admin, editor, viewer)
- Invitation system
- Permission management
- Access control

**Removal Scope**: All collaboration and multi-user functionality

### 3. Version Tracking
**Current Implementation**: Git-like versioning for projects
- Version creation and management
- Snapshot storage
- Version comparison
- Rollback capabilities

**Removal Scope**: Complete versioning system

### 4. Analytics and Usage Metrics
**Current Implementation**: Comprehensive analytics tracking
- Access tracking
- Usage statistics
- Popular files identification
- User activity monitoring
- Performance metrics

**Removal Scope**: All analytics and metrics collection

### 5. Export Capabilities
**Current Implementation**: Multiple export formats and options

## üóÇÔ∏è Code Removal Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Cleanup

#### Tables to Remove:
```sql
-- Template system
DROP TABLE project_templates;

-- Collaboration system  
DROP TABLE project_collaborators;
DROP TABLE project_tag_associations;
DROP TABLE project_tags;

-- Versioning system
DROP TABLE project_versions;

-- Analytics system
DROP TABLE project_analytics;

-- Advanced settings
DROP TABLE project_settings;
```

#### Tables to Keep:
```sql
-- Core tables only
projects (simplified)
project_files
upload_sessions
```

### Phase 2: Model Cleanup

#### Files to Remove:
```
backend/modules/projects/models.py     # Remove entirely
backend/modules/projects/schemas.py    # Remove entirely
backend/modules/projects/service.py    # Remove entirely  
backend/modules/projects/router.py     # Remove entirely
backend/modules/projects/README.md     # Remove entirely
backend/modules/projects/              # Remove entire directory
```

#### Models to Simplify:
```python
# backend/modules/upload/models.py
class Project(BaseModel, UUIDMixin):
    __tablename__ = "projects"
    
    # Keep only core fields:
    name = Column(String, nullable=False, index=True)
    description = Column(Text)
    upload_method = Column(String, nullable=False)
    upload_status = Column(String, default="pending")
    original_filename = Column(String)
    file_size = Column(BigInteger)
    parser_response = Column(JSON)  # Keep for parser integration
    parser_version = Column(String)
    
    # Keep only basic relationship
    files = relationship("ProjectFile", back_populates="project", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
    
    # REMOVE: All advanced relationships
    # collaborators, settings, tags, versions, analytics
```

### Phase 3: API Cleanup

#### Endpoints to Remove:
```
# Remove entire projects router
/api/v1/projects/*

# Remove from main.py:
app.include_router(projects_router, prefix="/api/v1")
```

#### Endpoints to Keep:
```
# Core upload functionality only
POST   /api/v1/upload/project
GET    /api/v1/upload/session/{session_id}
GET    /api/v1/upload/projects
GET    /api/v1/upload/projects/{project_id}
DELETE /api/v1/upload/projects/{project_id}
POST   /api/v1/upload/test-parser
GET    /api/v1/upload/health

# System endpoints
GET    /health
GET    /
```

### Phase 4: Service Layer Cleanup

#### Simplify Upload Service:
```python
# Keep only core methods:
- upload_project_intelligent()
- _extract_project_files()
- _upload_via_parser()
- _upload_direct()
- create_upload_session()

# Remove all advanced features:
- Template application
- Collaboration setup
- Analytics initialization
- Version creation
```

### Phase 5: Configuration Cleanup

#### Remove from core/config.py:
```python
# Remove entire ProjectsSettings class
# Keep only CoreSettings and UploadSettings
```

#### Environment Variables to Remove:
```bash
# All PROJECTS_* prefixed variables
PROJECTS_MAX_TEMPLATES_PER_USER
PROJECTS_MAX_COLLABORATORS_PER_PROJECT
PROJECTS_INVITATION_EXPIRY_DAYS
PROJECTS_EXPORT_MAX_FILE_SIZE
PROJECTS_ANALYTICS_RETENTION_DAYS
# etc.
```
