# TODO: Backend Architecture & Refactoring

This document outlines future improvements and architectural considerations for the REALM backend.

## 🎉 PHASE 1 COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ What We've Accomplished
- ✅ **Modular Architecture Foundation**: Complete directory restructure with feature-based modules
- ✅ **Core Infrastructure**: Enhanced configuration, database setup, and dependency injection
- ✅ **Upload Module Extraction**: Fully migrated upload functionality to `modules/upload/`
- ✅ **Shared Components**: Base models and cross-cutting concerns established
- ✅ **Enhanced Configuration**: Separated settings by module with environment prefixes
- ✅ **Clean Imports**: All imports updated to use new modular structure

## 🏗️ Current State Analysis

### ✅ Strengths (ENHANCED)
- ✅ **Clean Modular Architecture**: Feature-based modules with clear boundaries
- ✅ **Enhanced Configuration**: Separated CoreSettings and UploadSettings 
- ✅ **Shared Base Classes**: Eliminate code duplication across modules
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: Clean FastAPI dependency system
- ✅ **Intelligent upload system**: Preserved with fallback logic
- ✅ **Comprehensive API documentation**: Maintained through refactoring
- ✅ **Structured logging and error handling**: Enhanced with modular imports
- ✅ **Flexible database schema**: Improved with base model inheritance

### 🔧 Current Challenges
- ⚠️ **Database Connection**: Server startup may need DB configuration
- ⚠️ **Legacy Code Cleanup**: Old `app/` directory still exists for reference
- ⚠️ **Testing Coverage**: No comprehensive tests yet (foundation ready)
- ⚠️ **Authentication**: No auth system yet (planned for Phase 2)

- [ ] **Third-party Integrations**: GitHub, GitLab, Jira integration
- [ ] **Mobile API**: Optimized endpoints for mobile apps

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### ✅ Proven Patterns from Phase 1
1. **Follow Upload Module Structure**: Use `modules/upload/` as reference
2. **Inherit from Base Models**: Use `shared/models/base.py` patterns
3. **Module-specific Configuration**: Follow `core/config.py` separation pattern
4. **Dependency Injection**: Use `core/dependencies.py` patterns

### 🛠 Development Guidelines
- **Modular First**: Each feature should be self-contained
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests for new modules
- **Documentation**: Update docs as features are added
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API contracts

### 📊 Success Metrics
- **Code Quality**: Maintainable, well-documented modules
- **Performance**: Fast response times and efficient resource usage
- **User Experience**: Intuitive APIs and reliable functionality
- **Scalability**: Handle increased load and data volume

## 📋 Current Priorities (Next 30 Days)

### Week 1-2: Projects Module Foundation
1. **Design Enhanced Models**: Project templates, collaboration, permissions
2. **Implement CRUD Operations**: Advanced project management
3. **Build Project Router**: Enhanced endpoints with filtering and search
4. **Test Integration**: Ensure projects work with existing upload system

### Week 3-4: Chat Module Development  
1. **LLM Integration Setup**: Choose and integrate LLM providers
2. **Conversation Management**: Implement chat sessions and history
3. **Context System**: Link chats to specific projects and files
4. **API Development**: Build chat endpoints and real-time features

**✅ Current Status**: Phase 1 COMPLETE - Ready for Phase 2 module development  
**🎯 Next Milestone**: Projects Module (2 weeks)  
**🚀 Priority**: Begin `modules/projects/` implementation using proven patterns from upload module
